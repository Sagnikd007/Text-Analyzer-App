# Text-Analyzer-App
Its done in react using the concept of props and Use-State(React hook)

Basically, there is a text area where you can enter some text. Below that text area, there are few buttons that will perform an operation on the text. When any  button is clicked, a function will be triggered using (settext), which will operate on the text stored in the state variable, causing the text to undergo a change.
